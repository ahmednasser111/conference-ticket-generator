# Conference Ticket Generator

This project is a front-end application designed to generate a conference ticket for the "Coding Conf 2025" event. Users can upload their avatar, enter their details, and generate a personalized ticket that is sent to their email address.

## Features
- **Avatar Upload**: Users can upload their photo (JPG/PNG, max 500KB) for the conference ticket.
- **Form Validation**: Ensures that the user provides their full name, email address, and GitHub username.
- **Responsive Design**: The layout adjusts seamlessly across different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).
- **Ticket Generation**: After submitting the form, a personalized ticket is displayed with the userâ€™s details.
- **Interactive Buttons**: Change or delete the uploaded avatar image.
- **Email Confirmation**: The ticket will be sent to the user's email address after generation.
- **Dark Mode Support**: Users can toggle between light and dark themes for better accessibility.
- **Local Storage**: Saves user input temporarily to prevent data loss on accidental page refresh.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: Used for the structure of the web pages.
- **CSS**: Provides styling, including responsive design and dark mode support.
- **JavaScript**: Handles form validation, avatar upload, ticket generation logic, and theme toggling.
- **EmailJS**: Sends the generated ticket to the user's email address.
